---

I often find myself musing about religions and belief systems: what is professed by a church versus what its individuals actually believe, how religions split into sects, borrow ideas from each other, and how doctrines evolve over time.

As I’ve been reading [Building SimCity: How to Put the World in a Machine](https://direct.mit.edu/books/monograph/5791/Building-SimCityHow-to-Put-the-World-in-a-Machine), I felt inspired to try my hand at creating a simulation game of my own. Naturally, I started with what I enjoy most: building a data model for simulating the relationships and histories of religions and faiths.

While I haven’t actually built the simulation yet (and possibly never will), the data modeling exercise was a lot of fun, and I wanted to share my progress and thoughts.

## The Idea

This project began as a data modeling exercise with the hope of turning it into a simulation game.

There are plenty of simulations out there, but I wanted to create something that reflects my personal interests. I also wanted to focus on the data-modeling aspect, using tools like Django and SQL, rather than getting caught up in graphics or animations.

What came out of this effort is a data model designed to simulate the relationships and histories of religions and faiths.

The idea captivated me because it delves into the complexity of human connections with belief systems, organizations, and communities—and how these relationships shift and evolve over time.

## The Result - A UML File

I didn’t dedicate a lot of time to this project, but I’m satisfied with the progress I made on the data model. If inspiration strikes later, I might extend it into a UI, game, or full simulation. For now, my focus was on enjoying the process and documenting my thoughts.

See UML: [https://github.com/david-wolgemuth/religion-sim-data-model/blob/main/data-model.puml](https://github.com/david-wolgemuth/religion-sim-data-model/blob/main/data-model.puml)

The model centers around key entities like individuals, doctrines (abstract ideas or principles), organizations, faiths (systems of doctrines), and locations.

Relationships between these entities are represented using join tables, which include attributes like:
- **Sentiment**: Captures the strength of alignment (e.g., strongly agree, neutral, strongly disagree).
- **Weight**: Represents the relative importance of a connection (e.g., an individual’s affiliation with multiple organizations).

I also would plan to incorporate `django-simple-history` to track dynamic relationships and historical changes across all entities.

### Key Features of the Data Model:
- **Core Entities**: Individuals, doctrines, organizations, faiths, and locations.
- **Dynamic Relationships**: Tracks nuanced connections, such as individual beliefs or organizational affiliations.
- **Historical Tracking**: Uses `django-simple-history` for versioning and event tracking.

## The Process

### Initial Concept

I wanted to model the following:

- **Faiths**: Representing religions, cults, and sects as `Faith` entities.
- **Individuals**: Each person holds their own beliefs, belongs to multiple organizations, and interacts with locations. I chose `Individual` to avoid pluralization quirks like `Person/People`.
- **Doctrines**: Abstract principles that both individuals and faiths can align with, even when they don’t fully overlap.
- **Organizations**: Groups structured around shared doctrines or faiths. These can span multiple locations and sometimes bridge different faiths.
- **Events**: To track how relationships and histories evolve over time.

### Tools & Setup

I started with Django for its ORM and natural fit for relational databases. As the project shifted toward pure data modeling, I began using [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) to visualize relationships. PlantUML stood out for being:
- Keyboard-friendly (i'm a keyboard / vim guy).
- Easy to integrate with version control.
- Simple to share and refine with AI chat tools.

This project also became an experiment in leveraging AI for productivity. At each step, I used AI chat to refine my ideas, copy-pasting questions and answers into markdown files. I iterated by editing and re-submitting these responses until the data model felt complete.  (see the end of this post for a peek into this process).

---

### Challenges

- **Balancing Complexity**: Adding detailed attributes like `sentiment` while ensuring the model stayed efficient and maintainable.
- **Capturing Dynamic Relationships**: Designing flexibility for relationships like "disagreeing" with a belief without introducing unnecessary complexity.
- **Tracking Events**: Evaluating different approaches to aggregate historical data (e.g., SQL views, centralized logs, or polymorphic models).

---

## Reflection & Next Steps

I’m pleased with the data model I’ve built. It feels like a solid foundation for a simulation game. If I continue, my next steps would include:
- Building a functional simulation.
- Adding analytics or visualizations to track how relationships evolve over time.

Even if this project stays a data-modeling exercise, the process was rewarding. It sharpened my skills and gave me a creative outlet. I hope you found reading about it as enjoyable as I found building it!

## Bonus: Using AI for Data Model iteration and Blog Post writing

This post and the data model were crafted with the help of AI chat tools. I used AI to:

- Refine ideas and brainstorm solutions for dynamic relationships and event tracking.
- Generate initial drafts for this blog post and iterate on the writing process.

See the chats and iteration as I was modeling: [https://github.com/david-wolgemuth/religion-sim-data-model/tree/main/docs/chatlog](https://github.com/david-wolgemuth/religion-sim-data-model/tree/main/docs/chatlog)

I've also included key parts of the chats specific to writing this blog post below:

	•	MIT Press Book on SimCity: Inspiration for structuring complex simulations and dynamic systems.

Steps Taken
	1.	Brainstormed Features:
	•	Identified key entities (e.g., individuals, doctrines, organizations, faiths, locations) and their relationships.
	•	Discussed the need for attributes like sentiment and weight in join tables to capture dynamic relationships.
	2.	Designed Initial Data Model:
	•	Created UML diagrams to visualize core entities and their relationships.
	•	Focused on simplicity and flexibility, keeping attributes to a minimum in the early stages.
	3.	Integrated Historical Tracking:
	•	Chose django-simple-history for tracking changes and ensuring data integrity over time.
	•	Discussed options for centralized change logs across all models.
	4.	Explored Unified Event Tracking:
	•	Considered various methods (SQL views, centralized logging tables, dynamic aggregation) for aggregating history across models.
	5.	Refined the Model:
	•	Iteratively updated the data model based on feedback and discussions, balancing complexity and scalability.
	•	Added join table attributes like sentiment and weight to enrich relationships.

Challenges
	•	Complexity vs. Simplicity: Struggled to balance a flexible model with the simplicity needed for efficient queries and management.
	•	Event Tracking: Debated multiple approaches (e.g., SQL views, polymorphic tables) to create a unified history log across models, each with its pros and cons.
	•	Dynamic Relationships: Capturing nuanced relationships (e.g., individual sentiment toward doctrines) while avoiding redundancy was a key challenge.
	•	Inspiration from SimCity: Translating ideas from the book into practical design choices required careful thought about scalability and realism.

Time Spent
	•	Brainstorming and Research: ~3 hours, including reading and exploring simulation-based inspirations.
	•	Data Modeling: ~4-5 hours, iterating through different designs and UML diagrams.
	•	Historical Tracking Discussions: ~2 hours, evaluating tools and strategies for tracking changes across models.
	•	Total Time: ~10-12 hours so far, spread over several sessions to allow for iterative refinement and reflection.

Time management was guided by prioritizing clear deliverables for each session (e.g., finalize entities, test historical tracking).

    <summary>summarize the project i'm working on, and the idea</summary>

The Idea
	•	What: This project is a data modeling and tracking system for simulating relationships and histories in a religion or faith-based context. The model includes entities such as individuals, doctrines (abstract ideas or principles), organizations, faiths (systems of doctrines), and locations. Relationships between these entities are expressed using join tables, allowing for attributes like sentiment (e.g., strongly agree/disagree) or weight (e.g., importance). The project aims to track dynamic relationships, sentiments, and historical changes across all entities, leveraging tools like django-simple-history for versioning and centralized logging for unified insights into changes across all models.
	•	Why: The idea is compelling because it explores the complexity of human relationships with belief systems, organizations, and communities, and how these evolve over time. This is particularly relevant for creating simulations, games, or research tools where faith and societal structures play a central role. The project offers a unique intersection of data modeling, historical tracking, and behavioral simulation, making it an exciting technical challenge.
	•	Scope: The focus is on designing a flexible, scalable data model that prioritizes:
	•	Key entities (individuals, doctrines, organizations, faiths, locations).
	•	Dynamic relationships (e.g., individual alignment with doctrines, organizational affiliation).
	•	Historical tracking of changes across entities using django-simple-history.
	•	A unified way to view all historical changes across the system, either via SQL views, a centralized logging table, or dynamic aggregation in the application layer. Visualizations, UI/UX, and advanced analytics are out of scope for now.
